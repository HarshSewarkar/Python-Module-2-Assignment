Program 1: Basic Mathematical Operations

This program, task1.py, is designed to perform fundamental mathematical calculations. The script first prompts the user to input two numbers. It then uses these numbers to perform four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Finally, it displays the result of each operation in a clear, easy-to-read format. This program serves as a practical example of taking user input, performing arithmetic calculations, and formatting output in Python.

Program 2: Personalized Greeting

The second program, task2.py, focuses on string manipulation and user interaction. This script asks the user for their first name and last name separately. It then combines these two strings to create a single full name. Using this full name, the program generates and prints a personalized welcome message. This demonstrates how to concatenate strings and use variables to create dynamic and customized output, which is a common task in many applications.
